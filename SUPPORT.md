# Support Policy

Qlty offers community support for free users of the Qlty CLI on a best effort basis.

Certain plans of [Qlty Cloud](https://qlty.sh) also include standard, email-based support for paying customers.

The Qlty CLI follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) and is currently pre-1.0. Support is only provided for the latest, released version of the CLI.
